Built a responsive E-commerce user interface by combining product card layout and a sticky header, focusing on mastering core CSS layout concepts.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

🧩 display: block & display: inline-block for structured product cards

📐 Understanding spacing, width behavior, and alignment

📌 position: sticky vs position: fixed for real-world UI behavior

🧭 display: flex for aligning logo, search bar, and cart icon

🎯 Clean HTML structure and reusable CSS styling

Key Features:

🛒 E-commerce product cards with image, title, price, and description

📍 Sticky navigation header with logo, search bar, and cart icon
